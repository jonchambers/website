                <h1><b>About</b></h1>
                <p>
                    I am an artist and educator based in Chicago. I received an MFA in New Media Art from
                    the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2012 and currently teach media histories
                    at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and information aesthetics at UIC.
                    I have shown work nationally and internationally.
                    <br><br>
                    My work focuses on the production of art through technological objects, software, and
                    networked interfaces while aestheticizing experiences of saturation, obsessions, and
                    contradictions that emerge from relationships with these technologies. I often deal with
                    playful or humorous themes and am interested in the ephemeral space of technological
                    experiences and interactions. I use a range of mediums that merge media archaeological
                    and art histories with contemporary topics and practices.
                    <br><br>
                    I also work as a freelance web developer so hit me up at <a href="mailto:jon@jonchambers.net">jon@jonchambers.net</a>
